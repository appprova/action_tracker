# Action Tracker

Action and event trackers made easy. With this gem you can track your user actions without adding unnecessary code in your controllers.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'action_tracker'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install action_tracker

<!-- ## Usage

To use Action Tracker is easy, is needed to create a Tracker to any Controller to track. The structure of the files is simple.

To specify the tracker tool you want to use, you need to create a initializer and set the wanted tools.

```ruby
# config/initializers/action_tracker.rb
ActionTracker::Settings.configuration do |config|
  config.use_tool :mix_panel
  config.use_tool :dito
  config.use_tool :custom_tool
end
``` -->

The Tracker file structure must follow the controllers names and actions

### Simple usage

Simple add the wanted actions to track, with same name as the controller.

```ruby
# app/trackers/users_tracker.rb
class UsersTracker < ActionTracker::Base
  # This file tracks UsersController

  def index; end
  def show; end
  def create; end
end
```

### Advanced usage

The parameters that will be send to Tracker tools can be easily customized. As the example above, is necessary to create the action, same as controllers and the return will be send to tracker tool.

```ruby
# app/trackers/posts_tracker.rb
class PostsTracker < ActionTracker::Base
  # This file tracks PostsController

  def show
    {
      name: 'post-was-viewed',
      data: {
        post_id: @post.id,
        tags: @post.tags
      }
    }
  end
end
```

#### Options

| Name | Description | Default |
|--|--|--|--|
|*name*| The name of the tracked event.  | The controller action name. Eg.: 'users#index'|
